        <h2>Bunnies as Pets</h2>
        <p>Rabbits make wonderful indoor pets. They are adorable and brimming with personality. But before you swoop into the shelter and pick out a cutie, there are a few things you should know to ensure a rabbit is right for you and your family.<br>
        Every rabbit has a distinct personality and plenty of quirks — it’s up to you to get to know your rabbit companions and find theirs out.</p>

        <h2>Having a Bunny at Home</h2>
          <img class="Bunny" src="images/lop.jpeg" alt="Holland Lop" height="350">
        <p> <span class="Rabbit">No two rabbits are the same.</span> That’s one of the most endearing and rewarding things about living with rabbits — getting to know them. Your circumstances might mean that you have to keep your pet locked up for part of the day — but you won’t get to know what they’re really like unless you’re ready to spend plenty of quality time down on the floor with them.<br>


        “House rabbits can live to be 8 to 12 or more years old. With proper care, a rabbit will grace your home with love, sass, and comic relief. But they’re definitely not starter pets that can live in a cage. Instead, they are delicate prey animals that require time, attention, special diet, and expensive vet care,” Red Door Animal Shelter vice president Toni Greetis told INSIDER.<br>


        Rabbits are prey animals — and even after they get to know you, being picked up can be a bit too much like getting carried off by a hawk for their comfort.<br>

        “Although they are cute, rabbits are NOT good pets for children. They are prey animals who hate being picked up from the floor and cuddled. Rabbits do not have flexible spines like cats, so improper handling can cause serious or fatal injuries,” Greetis told INSIDER.<br>

        Of course, you’ll have to pick up your rabbit once in awhile. It’s inevitable. Make sure you know what you’re doing before picking up your rabbit to go in a carrier to the vet, or for any other reason.<br>

          <h2>Do Your Research!</h2>
          <img class="bunny2" src="images/bunny2.jpeg" alt="Bunny" width="250">
          <p>Do your research before adding a bunny to your family! While it’s easy to get swept up in the excitement of getting a pet rabbit, it’s important to first assess whether or not you can truly provide a good forever home to a bunny. If you’ve done your research and feel confident you can properly care for a bunny, please adopt a rabbit from a rescue or shelter instead of purchasing one from a breeder or pet store. Shelters are overflowing with homeless bunnies of all shapes and sizes.</p>
